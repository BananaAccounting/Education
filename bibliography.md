### [Forces for change in higher education and implications for the accounting academy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0748575116301993)
2017, Karen V.Pincusa, David E.StoutbJames E.SorensencKevin D.StocksdRaef A.Lawson
* Two major drivers–financial forces and technology force  
  * Financial forces: Within the next few decades, postsecondary institutions in the US will be driven to find significant new sources of revenues or new ways to significantly reduce expenditures to remain financially viable.
  * Technology forces
    * Offshoring and automation
    * Accounting/finance skills gap
* "Digital technologies provide the opportunity to both prepare students for 21st century careers and to create new financial models for higher education, but progress to date in using technology in new ways for teaching and learning has been slow."
* 2.3.2. The importance of strategic planning (very interesting view of challanges)  
  Unbundling, Flattening of the industry, Personalization/customization, Falculties role, Admission criteria, Student mix.
* 2.3.3. Examples of institutional responses
* Implications for accounting academia
  * "For almost 30 years, there have been regular calls for accounting education change to meet the needs of the evolving profession." ... "but overall the accounting curriculum and pedagogy of today still has much in common with the curriculum and pedagogy of the mid-1980 s."
  * 3.1.2. Adopting an accounting education framework for the 21st century

### [Beyond debits and credits: Using integrated projects to improve students’ understanding of financial accounting](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0748575117301914)  
2019, Jason C.Porter
* 3.1. Essential elements in an integrated project  
  * Focus on key concepts discussed in class  
    "While these key concepts can be covered in traditional homework assignments, asking students to make calculations and create the journal entries, use those entries to adjust the financial statements, and then use the updated financial statements to calculate financial ratios and predict likely investor reaction"  
  * Introduction to tax implications  
    "...it serves the intended purpose of requiring students to acknowledge that taxes affect almost every business decision."
  * Updating the financial statements  
    "Requiring students to adjust the financial statements for the effects of the journal entries they have made allows students to see how business decisions, and the journal entries associated with those decisions, affect a company."
  * Providing opportunities for financial analysis  
    "requiring students to calculate common ratios before and after making adjustments to the financial statements, then asking them what stakeholders"
  * Providing continuity throughout the project by working consistently with one company  
    "using only one company allows students to become familiar with that company, its goals and processes, and how the management team reacts and thinks, providing improved opportunities to ask questions about investor perceptions and ethical issues within the company. It also requires students to correct errors made in one portion before moving on to the next portion of the project."

* 3.2. Creating an integrated project  
* 4.2. Using class time for the project  
  * Traditional classes
  * Online classes
  * Flipped classes  
    "An integrated project provides an excellent in-class activity in a flipped, activity-based course because it not only allows students to practice, but also emphasizes or identifies the challenges students are having with the methods introduced in each chapter or with the accounting cycle."
      
### [Recommendations for an Integrated Competency-Based Framework for Accounting Education](https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/1494951/mod_resource/content/1/iace-50673.pdf)
2014, Raef A. Lawson (Chair), Edward J. Blocher, Peter C. Brewer, Gary Cokins,James E. Sorensen, David E. Stout, Gary L. Sundem, Susan K. Wolcott, andMarc J. F. Wouters
* Current situation  
  * Most  accounting  curricula  continue  to  focus  on  preparation  for  entry-levelrequirements  in  the  field  of  accounting,  despite  repeated  calls  for  a  longer-term  perspective.
  * Accounting education remains largely focused on preparing students for careers in publicaccounting/auditing,  despite  several  attempts  to  align  academic  curricula  with  the  demands  andresponsibilities of accounting practic
* Stategic perspective  
  * " the  organizational  field  of  accounting  mustdevelop a comprehensive understanding of its role in society. This effort requires a strategic view ofaccounting’s  value  proposition—how  accountants  add  value  to  organizations—and  a  curriculumbased on this value proposition. "
  * "The integrative role of accounting is important to creating value in an organization."
* Proposed educational framework  
  "The Pathways Commission (2012, 24) identified a need for a new model of education that isbetter   aligned   with   the   contemporary   environment   and   evolving   demands   on   accountingprofessionals.  To  address  this,  we  provide  the  general  Framework  presented  in  Figure  1.  ThisFramework includes three interconnected components: (1) Foundational Competencies, (2) BroadManagement Competencies, and (3) Accounting Competencies. It assumes these competencies aredeveloped   and   integrated   over   time   via   a   combination   of   education   (including   continuingeducation), training, and work experience."
